  <h3 class="wow">Description:</h3>
  <p class="xgg">From the data, the representation we can arrive at is the yearly lowest total sales on the basis of unit (the unit that
    did the least sales yearly). the total sales for different units (lb. and cartons) across various years. The sales data is organized
    into three columns: "Unit Name," "Year," and "Total Sales." The units include "lb" (pounds) and "cartons." The years range from 2014
    to 2022. The sales figures indicate the total quantity sold
    for each unit in a given year. The query focuses on understanding the sales trends over time and the performance of different units.
    <br><br>The table presents a clear picture of the sales performance over the years. Notable observations include a substantial increase
    in LB sales from 2014 to 2015, reaching 255.0,
    followed by a significant drop in 2016 to 15.0. The LB sales show a recovery in the subsequent years, particularly in 2018, with a total
    of 150.0. Cartons, on the other hand, made a notable entry in 2019 with sales of 114.0. The lb unit continued to dominate in 2020
    with 150.0 in sales, and cartons maintained a consistent performance in 2021 and 2022 with 133.0 and 240.0 in sales, respectively.
    <br><br>This detailed analysis of the sales data provides valuable insights into the performance of different units over the years. It allows
    businesses to identify trends and make informed decisions. Understanding the fluctuations in sales for each unit helps in production planning
    and marketing efforts. The graphical representation of year vs. total sales, with legends for lb and cartons, will visually highlight the trends
    and patterns, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the information. This allows you to lower or omit units that have the lowest sales, saving
    product costs
    and resources. This can also allow some units to continue to be produced if their sales tend to have a rising pattern over the years.
